                                    <p class="text-muted">As the world stood still during the COVID-19 lockdown, a small
                                        circle of young visionaries met in the heart of Shauriyako, Homa Bay County
                                        Kenya . What began as an informal hangout in an informal settlement quickly
                                        evolved into a powerful idea: meaningful development begins with critical
                                        awareness.
                                        We saw a gap projects often arrived before people were truly prepared to own
                                        them. We believed the first investment must be in mindset: building informed,
                                        inspired communities ready to shape their own futures. Out of that conviction,
                                        Initiative for Awareness and Development (IAD) was born merging awareness and
                                        action, and driving change that lasts
